	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p><b>Your security is very important to us.</b>  Seriously.  Very important.  We understand that by using DownJS you're trusting us not only to send you the correct scripts, but to not interfere with your users in any way - malicious or not.  While we have to keep our script search functionality hidden, everything else is open sourced and publically viewable on <a href="https://github.com/josephwegner">Github</a>.  Look for anything with a DownJS- prefix.  That will include this website, the DownJS script, and the tracking modules as referenced below.</p>
	
	<h2>Tracking</h2>
	<p>We also understand that it's important that your users aren't tracked in any ways that they haven't agreed to.  In the name of transparency, here's a list of things we will and will not do when it comes to tracking.</p>
	<h3>Things We Will Do</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>This public facing website is tracked using standard Google Analytics.  That only applies to the http://downjs.com and http://www.downjs.com domain.</li>
		<li>Our script searcher and loader is tracked with mixpanel.  We never store your domain name, or any user-specific information along with these results.  Each time a session is started with the script loader we assign a unique ID.  This ID is <b>only</b> used to track the flow of that current session, so we can pinpoint bottlenecks.</li>
		<li>When you upload a script to DownJS we <b>do</b> store user-specific details such as IP Address.  This data is necessary so we can weed out people uploading malicious or spammy content.</li>
		<li>We will keep this list updated, and will be intentional about informing you if anything changes.</li>
		<li>  We will consider you, our user, before making any changes to these policies, and will hold ourselves to the moral standard outlined on this page.</li>
	</ul>	
	<h3>Things We Won't Do</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>We will never track your users for simply loading the DownJS script.  The tracking begins once they request scripts from our servers.</li>
		<li>We will never sell, publicize, or in any other way share our tracking data.</li>
		<li>We will never prioritize anything higher than keep your users secure and our tracking minimal</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As an additional comfort to you, any tracking we do (beyond standard Google Analytics) is open sourced and publically viewable on <a href="https://github.com/josephwegner/DownJS-Tracking">Github</a>.<p>
